# FLUX.1-Kontext-pro Migration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Configuration Variables
- Replaced `DALLE_*` variables with `FLUX_*` variables
- Updated `.env` file to use FLUX endpoint and API version
- Changed deployment name to "FLUX.1-Kontext-pro"

### 2. Updated Code References
- Replaced `dalle_client` with `flux_client` 
- Updated `dalle_deployment` to `flux_deployment`
- Modified error messages to reference FLUX instead of DALL-E

### 3. Enhanced Image-to-Image Support
- Added proper base64 encoding for reference images in FLUX API calls
- Maintained GPT-4 Vision analysis for reference images
- Updated image parameter handling for FLUX API

### 4. Configuration Required

**IMPORTANT:** You need to update your `.env` file with the correct FLUX API key:

```env
FLUX_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_FLUX_API_KEY_HERE
```

The API key should be a string of characters (not a URL). You mentioned the API key was the same as the URL, but API keys are typically alphanumeric strings like:
`abc123def456ghi789...`

### 5. Key Benefits of FLUX.1-Kontext-pro
- Better support for image-to-image generation
- Enhanced architectural visualization capabilities
- More flexible prompt handling

### 6. Testing
Once you update the API key, you can test:
1. Text-to-image generation
2. Image-to-image transformation with uploaded reference images
3. Architectural style variations

### 7. API Endpoint Structure
Your FLUX endpoint: `https://chatproject100.services.ai.azure.com`
API Version: `2025-04-01-preview`
Model Deployment: `FLUX.1-Kontext-pro`

## Next Steps
1. Get the correct API key for your FLUX deployment
2. Update `FLUX_API_KEY` in your `.env` file
3. Test the application with both text-to-image and image-to-image generation
